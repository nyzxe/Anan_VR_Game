# Target_Practice
Target Practice is a virtual reality shooting game which I completed during my time in Japan. 

The game takes inspiration from shooting game stands in Japanese festivals, but with some added twists, where the player must shoot down targets which appear in front of them under a time limit. 

Targets include friendly and enemy targets, which add or deduct score for the player respectively, and the targets' designs comprise of the Oni, Obake, Ananan and Sudachi-kun designs, the latter two of which are mascots of Anan and Tokushima respectively. 

Players can choose between several weapons, including pistols, sub-machine guns, a shotgun, a rifle and bombs, to shoot down the targets during the course of the game.
